JIKA ERROR
=============
Heroku problem : The page you were looking for doesn't exist

REFF : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7376966/heroku-problem-the-page-you-were-looking-for-doesnt-exist/26756757



1. I got the same problem; however, after changing 1 line code of production.rb located in config/environments/production.rb from

config.assets.compile = false

to

config.assets.compile = true


CARA 2
===========

I'm using postgresql, and I also had page not showing up on heroku.

This command fixed it:

1. heroku run rake db:setup

and then

2. heroku rake db:migrate

I had migrated before, but hadn't done the setup first.

I also had tried setting

3. config.assets.compile = true

in production.rb, but that made no difference.
